**What does this mean?**

First we have a 45 minute call with you to understand more about your personal and career goals. In order to transform your profile we need to know all about your work history, achievements, current role and future goals. Then we can tailor your profile and make it work for you to achieve your goals.

**The profile makeover**

We can make recommendations, based on our call, across all key sections of your profile. We’ll tailor it to your objectives. It could be personal branding, looking for a new job, starting your own business or becoming more engaged on the platform. We’ll make it work for you.
We’ll also help with your headline and summary, **the most important part of your profile.** We’ll write two variations so you can choose whether to amend yourself or just add the one you like.
